## 🍍 Project Started – Fruits Store App

Today I started building a small **Fruits Store App** to practice React concepts (state, props, effects), UI layout, and basic shopping interactions.

---

## 🎯 Goal
Create a simple, responsive store app where users can:
- Browse fruit products (image, name, price)
- Filter products by category or search term
- Add products to a cart and view the cart list
- Increase/decrease item quantity and remove items
- Persist cart to `localStorage` (optional)

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React.js (functional components + hooks)  
- **Styling:** CSS / Bootstrap (or React Bootstrap)  
- **Storage:** `localStorage` for cart persistence (optional)  
- **Optional:** Netlify / Vercel for deployment

---

## ✅ Work Done (Today)
- Set up project scaffold (`create-react-app` or Vite)
- Created basic folder structure:
