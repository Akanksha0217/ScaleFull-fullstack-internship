## ðŸŽ¯ JavaScript String Methods â€“ Practice Questions

Todayâ€™s focus was on advanced string manipulation using JavaScript. These tasks helped reinforce logic building, string handling, and problem-solving skills.

### ðŸ§ª Q1: Insert a String into the Middle of Another String

- Assigned two strings: a **base string** and a **string to insert**.
- Calculated the **middle index** of the base string using `Math.floor(length / 2)`.
- Split the base string into two parts using `slice()`.
- Inserted the second string between the two parts.
- Combined and returned the new string with the insertion.

### ðŸ§ª Q2: Memo â€“ Find Most Repeated Character and Its Count

- Assigned a test string.
- Initialized an object to store character frequencies.
- Used a `for...of` loop to count the occurrences of each character.
- Tracked the most repeated character and its count during iteration.
- Final output:
  - The character that appeared **most frequently**
  - The **number of times** it appeared

## âœ… Concepts Practiced

- String slicing using `.slice(start, end)`
- Math operations (`Math.floor()`) to find the midpoint
- Frequency counting using JavaScript objects
- Iterating strings with `for...of`
- Tracking and comparing values during a loop

---

## ðŸ§  Key Takeaways

- String manipulation is powerful when combined with loops and conditionals.
- Object-based frequency maps are very useful for problems like:
  - Counting characters
  - Detecting duplicates
  - Solving coding interviews
