## ðŸŽ¯ JavaScript Practice â€“ Problem Solving with Arrays, Numbers & Strings

Continued working on problem-solving and logic-building using JavaScript. Focus was on arrays, string operations, number manipulation, and algorithmic thinking.

---

### ðŸ§ª Q13: Find Pairs Whose Sum is 10
- Assigned an array of numbers.
- Used nested loops or a map to find all pairs where `num1 + num2 === 10`.
- Printed the pair(s) found.

---

### ðŸ§ª Q14: Create a Duplicate of an Array
- Used spread operator `[...array]` or `.slice()` method.
- Created a new array identical to the original.

---

### ðŸ§ª Q15: Most Repeated Character and Its Count
- Took a string input.
- Created a frequency object to count each character.
- Found the character with the **maximum frequency**.
- Output: most repeated character and how many times it appeared.

---

### ðŸ§ª Q16: Sum of Numbers Within a Range
- Used a function with two parameters `start` and `end`.
- Used a loop to sum all numbers from `start` to `end`.
- Returned or logged the final sum.

---

### ðŸ§ª Q17: Swap Two Numbers Without Using a Third Variable
- Used arithmetic operations:
  - `a = a + b`
  - `b = a - b`
  - `a = a - b`

---

### ðŸ§ª Q18: Reverse a Given Number
- Converted number to string, reversed it, and converted back.
- Handled both logic using `while` loop and string methods.

---

### ðŸ§ª Q19: Remove Duplicates from Array
- Used `Set()` to filter unique values.
- Alternatively, used `.filter()` with `.indexOf()` or a lookup object.

---

## âœ… Skills Practiced

- Working with loops (`for`, `while`)
- Array manipulation
- Using objects as maps for counting
- Arithmetic tricks
- String and number conversions

---

## ðŸ§  Key Takeaways

- Solving small challenges builds foundational logic.
- Multiple ways exist to solve the same problem â€” important for interviews.
- JavaScript provides versatile tools (`Set`, spread, `filter`, arithmetic ops) to solve real-world coding tasks.
