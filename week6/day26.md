## 🧠 Topics Learned – Introduction to JavaScript

I focused on understanding the basics and core building blocks of JS.

---

### ✨ JavaScript Features
- Interpreted, lightweight, and high-level language
- Supports **event-driven** and **functional programming**
- Runs in the browser and enables interactive features on web pages

---

### 🔍 Importance & Uses
- Used for client-side interactivity (DOM manipulation, form validation)
- Used in full-stack development (Node.js)
- Core technology for front-end frameworks like React, Angular, Vue

---

### 🧾 Key Concepts Covered

#### 🟢 Variables in JS
- `var` – Function scoped  
- `let` – Block scoped  
- `const` – Block scoped and cannot be reassigned

#### 🧠 Data Types
- **Primitive**: String, Number, Boolean, Null, Undefined, Symbol, BigInt  
- **Non-Primitive**: Object, Array, Function

#### 🔢 Operators
- **Arithmetic Operators**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `**`  
- **Assignment Operators**: `=`, `+=`, `-=`, etc.  
- **Comparison Operators**: `==`, `===`, `!=`, `!==`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`  
- **Logical Operators**: `&&`, `||`, `!`  
- **Bitwise Operators**: `&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>`  
- **Type Operators**: `typeof`, `instanceof`

---

### ✅ Practice
- Used all arithmetic and logical operators in small code examples
- Practiced using `typeof` to check types  
- Compared values using `==` vs `===`
