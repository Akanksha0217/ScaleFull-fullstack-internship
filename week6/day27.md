# 📅 Day 27 – July 22, 2025

## 🧠 Topics Learned – JavaScript Control Flow & Patterns

---

### 🔁 Loops
- `for` loop – used for fixed number of iterations
- `while` loop – used when number of iterations not known beforehand
- `do...while` loop – runs at least once before checking the condition

---

### 🔍 Conditional Statements
- `if`, `else if`, `else` – used to run code blocks based on conditions
- Practiced combining conditions with `&&` and `||`

---

### 🔧 Functions
- Learned how to define and call functions using:
  - `function myFunc() {}` syntax
  - Parameters and return values
- Explored **function scope** and reusability

---

### ✨ Pattern Practice
- Created different star patterns using nested loops and functions:
  - Right-aligned triangle  
  - Pyramid pattern  
  - Inverted triangle  
  - Square and hollow square

---

### ✅ Practice Focus
- Used loops and conditions to build logic for pattern printing
- Combined function logic with user input (like number of rows)

---

## 📌 Next Step
- Learn about Arrays and how to loop through them  
- Start using objects and DOM methods
