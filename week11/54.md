## ðŸ”„ Continued Work â€“ Tic Tac Toe Game with AI

Today I continued working on the **Tic Tac Toe game**.

---
### âœ… Progress Made
- Implemented **win condition check**:
  - Checked all rows, columns, and diagonals for "X" or "O".
  - Declared winner and disabled further moves.
- Added **reset button** to restart the game.
- Basic **AI opponent**:
  - AI makes a random move in available cells after playerâ€™s turn.
  - Ensures valid moves only.

---
### ðŸ§  Learnings
- Improved my logic for **checking multiple win conditions** efficiently.
- Practiced writing **helper functions** (e.g., `checkWinner()`, `resetGame()`).
- Learned how to integrate simple **AI decision-making** with JavaScript.

---
### ðŸ“Œ Next Steps
- Upgrade AI from **random moves â†’ smarter moves** (minimax or strategy).
- Add scoreboard (track wins/draws).
- Style the UI for better **game feel**.
