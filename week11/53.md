## ðŸŽ® Project Started â€“ Tic Tac Toe Game with AI

Today I began working on a **Tic Tac Toe game** using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

---

### âœ… Work Done
- Set up project structure:
tic-tac-toe/
â”œâ”€ index.html
â”œâ”€ style.css
â””â”€ script.js

- Designed the **game board** using a 3x3 grid (CSS Grid).
- Added clickable cells with hover effects.
- Implemented **basic player move logic**:
- Player "X" and "O" alternate turns.
- Click disables further changes in that cell.

---

### ðŸ§  Learnings
- Practiced **DOM event listeners** for multiple grid cells.
- CSS **grid system** is ideal for laying out the 3x3 board.
- Improved understanding of **state management** (tracking current player).

---

### ðŸ“Œ Next Steps
- Detect **win conditions** (rows, columns, diagonals).
- Display winner or draw message.
- Start implementing **AI opponent** logic for single-player mode.
