## 📝 Mini Project – To-Do List App

Today, I built a simple **To-Do List Project** using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** to practice taking user input and managing lists dynamically.

---

### ✅ Features Implemented
1. **Take Input from User**
   - Used an `<input>` field to enter tasks.
   - Added validation to check for empty or invalid inputs.

2. **Add Tasks**
   - On clicking the **Add** button, the new task is added to the list as an `<li>`.
   - Each task is displayed one by one in order of entry.

3. **Delete Tasks**
   - Each `<li>` item has a **Delete (❌)** button.
   - Clicking the delete button removes only that task from the list.

### 📌 Next Steps
- Add a **"Mark as Completed"** option (strike-through text when done).  
- Style the list using CSS for better UI (colors, hover effects).  
- Store tasks in **localStorage** so the list persists after page reload.

### 🧠 Key Takeaways
- Learned how to take **user input** via JavaScript and validate it.  
- Practiced dynamically creating and appending elements (`createElement`, `appendChild`).  
- Implemented **event delegation** for delete buttons.  
- Improved confidence in handling **DOM manipulation** with JS.
