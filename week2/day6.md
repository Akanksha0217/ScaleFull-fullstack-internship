# 📅 Day 6 – June 23, 2025

## ✅ Topics Learned

- Introduction to the `<meta>` tag in HTML:
  - `charset`, `name`, `keywords`, `author`, `viewport`, etc.
- Learned the purpose and structure of the **DOM (Document Object Model)**
- Created a **tree diagram** to represent the DOM hierarchy
- Learned why **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)** is used in web development:
  - For styling, layout, colors, spacing, fonts, etc.
- Explored **3 ways to add CSS** to an HTML document:
  - **Inline CSS** – within elements using the `style` attribute
  - **Internal CSS** – using `<style>` in the `<head>`
  - **External CSS** – linking `.css` file using `<link>` tag

## 🛠️ Work Done

- Added meta tags to HTML files for better SEO and documentation
- Drew a basic DOM tree (HTML → Head, Body → Elements)
- Tried all three CSS methods and compared the use cases
- Created a small demo page with styles applied in different ways

## 💡 Notes

- `meta` tags help browsers understand the page content and character encoding
- DOM represents HTML as a tree structure and can be manipulated via JavaScript
- Best practice is to use **external CSS** for better maintainability
