### 🎨 1. CSS Gradients

Gradients allow you to create smooth transitions between two or more colors without using images.

#### 📌 Types of Gradients:

- **Linear Gradient**
  - Colors transition in a straight line.
  ```css
  background: linear-gradient(to right, red, yellow);
  ```

  - **Radial Gradient**
  - Colors radiate outward from a center point.
   ```css
  - background: radial-gradient(circle, blue, lightblue);
    ```
   
   -**Conic Gradient**
  -Colors are rotated around a center point like a pie chart (newer feature).
 ```css
background: conic-gradient(from 0deg, red, yellow, green, red);
 ```

### 🖋️ 2. CSS Fonts
- font-family: Defines the font style.
- font-weight: Controls the thickness/boldness of text.
- font-style: Used for italicizing or styling text.

### 🛠️ Work Done
- Created a demo using all 3 gradient types as backgrounds
- Applied custom fonts and font weights to text
- Added shadows to text headers and product boxes
