## 🔄 Continued Work – Supermarket App

Today, I continued working on the **Supermarket App** project (HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JS).

---

### ✅ Progress Made
- Enhanced **product display** layout with Bootstrap grid system.  
- Improved **hover effects** for product cards.  
- Refined **Add to Cart** functionality:
  - Prevented duplicate entries by updating quantity if the product is already in the cart.
  - Updated cart dynamically with item name, price, and quantity.
- Worked on **Remove from Cart** feature to delete items individually.  
- Practiced DOM methods like `querySelector`, `innerText`, and `classList`.

### 📌 Next Steps
- Implement **total price calculation** in the cart.  
- Add **checkout button** and simple form validation.  
- Work on **responsive design** for mobile screens.

### 🧠 Key Takeaways
- Strengthened understanding of **DOM CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete).  
- Learned to **handle duplicate products** in cart logic.  
- Bootstrap’s **grid and card components** make UI development faster.
