## ðŸŽ¯ React.js Learning Notes  

Today, I focused on important **React concepts**: component lifecycle, how components work, and promises in JavaScript.

### ðŸ“š Topics Learned  

#### ðŸ”¹ React Lifecycle  
- The **lifecycle of a React component** has three main phases:  
  1. **Mounting** â€“ when a component is created and inserted into the DOM.  
     - Methods: `constructor()`, `render()`, `componentDidMount()`.  
  2. **Updating** â€“ when a component is re-rendered due to state or prop changes.  
     - Methods: `shouldComponentUpdate()`, `render()`, `componentDidUpdate()`.  
  3. **Unmounting** â€“ when a component is removed from the DOM.  
     - Method: `componentWillUnmount()`.  

- In **functional components**, React Hooks (`useEffect`) are used to handle lifecycle behavior.

#### ðŸ”¹ How Components Work in React  
- Components are the **building blocks** of a React application.  
- Two types:  
  - **Functional Components** (use hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`).  
  - **Class Components** (use lifecycle methods).  
- Components **receive data via props** and **manage internal data via state**.  
- Reusable, modular, and improve maintainability of applications.  

---

#### ðŸ”¹ Promises in JavaScript  
- A **Promise** represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation.  
- States of a Promise:  
  - `pending` â€“ initial state.  
  - `fulfilled` â€“ operation completed successfully (`resolve`).  
  - `rejected` â€“ operation failed (`reject`).  
- Used with `.then()`, `.catch()`, and `.finally()` for handling asynchronous tasks.  
- Example use case: fetching data from an API.

### ðŸ§  Key Takeaways  
- React lifecycle helps manage component behavior at different stages.  
- Components are reusable and make UI development modular.  
- Promises simplify asynchronous operations and prevent "callback hell".
