## 🔄 Continued Work on:

### 🍦 Project: Natural Ice Cream Website (Clone)

Today, I made further progress on the Natural Ice Cream Website clone.  
Focused on creating additional internal pages for a more complete structure.

## 📄 Pages Created

1. **📝 Blog Page**
   - Layout for future blog entries or articles
   - Placeholder sections with headers and sample content

2. **🍃 Ingredient Story Page**
   - Describes the natural and fresh ingredients used
   - Structured using semantic tags like `<section>` and `<article>`

3. **🍨 Product Page**
   - Lists available ice cream products
   - Used card-style layout with product name, images, and basic info
   - Implemented CSS Grid or Flexbox for product alignment

## 🧠 Skills Practiced

- Semantic HTML (`<section>`, `<header>`, `<main>`, `<article>`)
- Creating multi-page websites using linked `<a href="page.html">` navigation
- Improved layout skills with:
  - Flexbox and Grid systems
  - Internal page linking
  - Page content planning and consistency

---

## 🔗 Navigation Update

- Updated **navbar** to include links to:
  - Home
  - Blog
  - Ingredients

## 💡 Key Learnings
