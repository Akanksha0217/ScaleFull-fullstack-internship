## ðŸŽ¯ React.js Learning Notes  

### ðŸ”¹ `useState` â€“ Why Use It & What It Is  
- `useState` is a **React Hook** that lets you add **state** to functional components.  
- Without state, React components are static and cannot update dynamically.  
- State helps components **remember values** between renders (e.g., input values, counters).  
- `useState` returns an **array** with:
  1. Current state value.
  2. Function to update that value.

Example:
```js
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
```

### ðŸ”¹ Render vs Re-render
#### Render:
- Happens when a component first appears in the UI.
- React builds the virtual DOM tree and shows it in the browser.

#### Re-render:
- Happens when a componentâ€™s state or props change.
- React compares the old and new virtual DOM (diffing) and updates only the changed parts.
