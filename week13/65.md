### ðŸ“š Topics Learned  

#### ðŸ”¹ React Router DOM  
- A library for handling **routing/navigation** in React applications.

  - `<Routes>` and `<Route>` â†’ Define paths and components to render.  
  - `<Link>` and `<NavLink>` â†’ For navigation without reloading the page.

#### ðŸ”¹ React Bootstrap  
- A popular UI framework integrated with React.  
- Provides **ready-to-use components**: Navbar, Cards, Modals, Buttons, Forms, etc.
