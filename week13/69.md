## ðŸŽ¯ React.js Learning Notes  

### ðŸ”¹ `useEffect`  
- A React Hook used for performing **side effects** in functional components.  
- Examples of side effects:
  - Fetching data from an API  
  - Subscribing to events  
  - Updating the DOM manually  
- Syntax:
  ```js
  useEffect(() => {
    // side effect logic
  }, [dependencies]);  ```
  
- The dependency array controls when the effect runs:
- Empty [] â†’ runs once after first render.
- With variables [count] â†’ runs whenever count changes.

### ðŸ”¹ Props
- Props (short for properties) are used to pass data from parent to child components.
- They make components reusable by customizing them with different values.

###ðŸ”¹ Prop Drilling
- Occurs when props are passed through multiple nested components just to reach a deeply nested child.
- Can make code harder to maintain.
- Example: Parent â†’ Child â†’ Grandchild (passing the same prop).
- Solutions: Context API or state management libraries.

###ðŸ”¹ State Uplifting
- Technique of lifting state up to the nearest common ancestor component.
- Useful when two or more components need to share the same state.
- Instead of managing state in each child, state is kept in the parent and passed down as props.
