### 🍦 Project: Natural Ice Cream Website (Clone)

Today, I made further progress on the **Natural Ice Cream homepage clone**.  
My main focus was on **making the website responsive** across different screen sizes.

---

## ✅ Tasks Completed

- Implemented **media queries** to adjust layout on:
  - Tablets
  - Mobile phones
- Modified font sizes, paddings, and margins for better fit on smaller screens
- Adjusted image scaling and grid layout to wrap correctly on narrow viewports
- Tested all 3 pages (Blog, Ingredients Story, Products) on:
  - Desktop view
  - Tablet view
  - Mobile view

## 🧠 Key Learnings

- How to use `@media` queries effectively
- Importance of setting flexible widths using `%` and `auto`
- Applied:
  - `flex-wrap`, `grid-template-columns`, and `min-width` properties
- Understood the value of **mobile-first design**

## 🔜 Next Steps

- Add a responsive **footer section**
- Smooth hover transitions and mobile-friendly buttons
- Final testing before deployment
