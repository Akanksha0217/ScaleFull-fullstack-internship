## 🚀 Started Working with Bootstrap

Began learning and practicing **Bootstrap**, a popular front-end CSS framework used to quickly design and develop responsive websites.

## ✅ Topics Covered

### 💡 Why Use Bootstrap?
- Speeds up development with pre-built components
- Ensures **mobile-first** and **responsive** design
- Provides consistent styling across all browsers
- Easy to integrate with existing HTML projects

---

## 🧪 Bootstrap Components Practiced

### 📌 Navbar
- Created a responsive **navigation bar**
- Included brand name, navigation links, and collapse on mobile
- Used Bootstrap’s `navbar`, `navbar-expand`, and `navbar-toggler` classes

### 📦 Card
- Built Bootstrap **cards** to display content and images
- Practiced adding shadows, buttons, and grid alignment

### 🎨 Background & Buttons
- Used utility classes like:
  - `bg-primary`, `bg-light`, `bg-dark`
  - `btn`, `btn-outline-success`, `btn-danger`, etc.

### 📝 Forms
- Created responsive forms using:
  - `form-group`, `form-control`, and `form-check`
- Used input types like text, email, checkbox, radio

## 💡 Key Learnings

- Bootstrap reduces the need to write custom CSS
- Using the grid system (`row`, `col-`) makes layout simple and flexible
- Bootstrap components are **responsive by default**
- Forms and navbars are styled cleanly without much setup

---

## 🔜 Next Steps

- Practice using the **Grid system** more deeply
- Customize Bootstrap with your own CSS
- Try building a small project/page using only Bootstrap
