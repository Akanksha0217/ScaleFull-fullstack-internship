# 📅 Day 15 – July 4, 2025

## ✅ Topics Learned

### 🧱 1. CSS `display` Property

The `display` property defines how an element is displayed on the page.

#### 🔹 `block`
- Takes up the full width
- Starts on a new line
```css
div {
  display: block;
}  
```

#### 🔹 `inline`
- Takes only as much width as needed
- Does not start on a new line

  #### 🔹 `inline-block`
  - Behaves like inline, but allows setting width, height, padding, and margin

#### 🔹 `none`
- Completely hides the element from the page (not even space is reserved)
