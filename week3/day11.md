# 📅 Day 11 – June 30, 2025

## ✅ Activities & Practice

Today, I began applying my previous HTML and CSS learning to create a **clone of a website** called **FoodMart**.

---

## 🛠️ Work Done

- Started building a **FoodMart clone** using only HTML and CSS
- Focused on:
  - Page layout structure
  - Header, navigation, and banner sections
  - Using CSS for basic styling and positioning
- Practiced organizing files (HTML, CSS, image folders)

---

## 🔗 Project Link (Local)

> Link of clone website('https://themewagon.github.io/FoodMart/index.html')


> 🔹 Note: This link works only on my local machine using Live Server in VS Code.

---

## 🧠 Key Learning

- Applied semantic HTML (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`)
- Used CSS properties like `display`, `flex`, `margin`, `padding`, and `background`
- Understood how layout and spacing work across page sections

---

## 📌 Next Steps

- Complete remaining sections like products, footer, and responsiveness
- Link pages if the original site has multiple sections
- Plan to host the project on GitHub and deploy using Netlify
