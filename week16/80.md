## 🖥️ Project – ERP Student Dashboard (React.js)

Today, I started working on a **Student ERP Dashboard** project using **React.js**.  
The goal is to design and build a dashboard interface where students can manage and view academic information.

---

### ✅ Work Done
- Set up **React project structure** using `create-react-app` / `Vite`.
- Created basic **dashboard layout** with sidebar and header.
- Added placeholder sections for:
  - 📚 Courses
  - 🧾 Attendance
  - 📝 Assignments
  - 📊 Results
- Used **React components** for modular design.

---

### 📚 Concepts Practiced
- React **component-based architecture**
- **Props & State** for passing and managing data
- Basic **React Router** setup for navigation (Home, Courses, Results, etc.)
- Used **CSS modules / Tailwind** for styling dashboard elements

---

### 📌 Next Steps
- Connect dummy data (JSON or static arrays) to display in tables/cards.
- Add charts (using **Recharts or Chart.js**) for attendance & performance visualization.
- Implement **responsive design** for mobile and tablet.
- Plan future API integration for real student data.

---

### 🧠 Key Takeaways
- React makes it easy to split a dashboard into **reusable components**.
- State management will be crucial once real data is integrated.
- A clear layout plan (sidebar + main content) helps in scaling the dashboard later.
