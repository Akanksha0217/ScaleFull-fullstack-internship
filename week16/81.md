## ðŸ”„ Continued Work â€“ *Student ERP Dashboard*

Today, I continued building the **Student ERP Dashboard** project using React.js.

---
### âœ… Progress Made
- Enhanced **dashboard layout** with sidebar and top navigation bar.  
- Added routing for different sections (Courses, Attendance, Assignments, Results).  
- Created reusable **Card and Table components** for displaying student data.  
- Started working on **dummy JSON data integration** for testing.  

---
### ðŸ“š Concepts Practiced
- **React Router v6** for page navigation.  
- Component reusability and props drilling.  
- Styling with **Bootstrap + custom CSS** for responsive design.  
- Managing state with `useState` and rendering lists with `.map()`.  

---
### ðŸ“Œ Next Steps
- Integrate charts (attendance & performance graphs) using **Recharts**.  
- Build a **login page** for students and faculty.  
- Add CRUD operations for assignments (Create, Update, Delete).  
- Plan API endpoints for connecting with backend (Node.js + MongoDB).

### ðŸ§  Key Takeaways
- Proper **component architecture** makes scaling easier.  
- React Router simplifies **multi-page dashboards**.  
- Mock data is useful for testing UI before backend integration.
