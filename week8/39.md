## 🎯 JavaScript Practice – `reduce()` Method & DOM Basics

### 📝 Activity Summary:
Continued practicing JavaScript fundamentals with a focus on the `reduce()` method and DOM concepts in vanilla JS.

---

### 🔍 Questions Solved:

#### 🔸 Q6: Create a String from an Array
- Joined array elements into a single string using `reduce()`.

#### 🔸 Q7: Remove Duplicates from Array
- Eliminated repeated values using `reduce()` by checking if the element already exists in the accumulator.

#### 🔸 Q8: Group by Property
- Grouped an array of objects based on a specific property (e.g., type, category) using `reduce()`.

### 📚 Learned:
- **DOM (Document Object Model)** basics:
  - Understanding how HTML elements are represented as objects.
  - Accessing elements with methods like `getElementById`.
  - Manipulating element content and styles using vanilla JS.
  

- **Vanilla JavaScript**:
  - No frameworks or libraries, only core JS methods for DOM manipulation.
  - Directly interacting with the browser environment.

### 🧠 Key Takeaways:
- `reduce()` is highly flexible for array data transformations.
- DOM manipulation in vanilla JS forms the foundation before moving to frameworks like React.
- Grouping data with `reduce()` is especially powerful for organizing complex datasets.
