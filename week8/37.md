## 🎯 JavaScript Test Practice – `filter()` and `reduce()` Methods

### 📝 Activity Summary:
- ✅ Practiced solving JavaScript questions using **`filter()`** and **`reduce()`** array methods.
- ✅ Focused on understanding how to manipulate and extract data from arrays.
- ✅ Solved both logic-based and practical problems using these methods.

---

### 🔍 Concepts Practiced:

#### 🔹 `filter()` Method:
- Filtering even and odd numbers from an array.
- Extracting specific values based on conditions (e.g., age > 18, status === 'active').
- Removing falsy values or unwanted elements.

#### 🔹 `reduce()` Method:
- Calculating the **sum**, **product**, or **average** of elements in an array.
- Flattening nested arrays.
- Counting occurrences of elements (e.g., character or word frequency).
- Creating grouped or structured outputs from raw arrays.

---

### ✨ Key Takeaways:
- `filter()` is used to **select** items based on a condition.
- `reduce()` is used to **accumulate** a single value from multiple elements.
- Powerful tools for **data processing** in functional JavaScript.

---

### ✅ Goal:
Apply these methods in real-world use cases like form data processing, data analytics, and building UI filters.
