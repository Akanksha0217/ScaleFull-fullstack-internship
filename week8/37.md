## 🎯 JavaScript Test Practice – `filter()` Method

### 📝 Activity Summary:
- ✅ Practiced multiple JavaScript test-based questions using the `filter()` method.
- ✅ Focused on filtering strings, words, and removing duplicates from arrays.
- ✅ Implemented real-use examples that enhance understanding of array manipulation.

### 🔍 Questions Solved:

#### 🔸 Q1: Write only when the task is marked as "done"
- Used `filter()` to extract objects or strings with a status of "done".

#### 🔸 Q2: Filter words that contain `'js'`
- Filtered out strings from an array that include the substring `"js"` (e.g., `"learn-js"`, `"js-tutorial"`).

#### 🔸 Q3: Filter only strings from a mixed array
- Used `typeof` check inside `filter()` to extract only string elements from an array containing mixed data types.

#### 🔸 Q4: Remove duplicate values from an array
- Applied `filter()` along with `indexOf` or `Set` to eliminate duplicate entries from an array.

### 🧠 Key Learnings:
- `filter()` is a powerful method for refining datasets based on conditions.
- Can be combined with string methods (`includes()`, `startsWith()`), type checks, or custom logic.
- Ideal for cleaning, sorting, and narrowing down user input or fetched data.
