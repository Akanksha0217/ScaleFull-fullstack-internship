## 🎯 JavaScript Test Practice – `reduce()` Method

### 📝 Activity Summary:
Practiced multiple interview-style questions using the `reduce()` method in JavaScript. Gained hands-on experience in array transformations, aggregation, and data manipulation using a single loop.

---

### 🔍 Questions Solved:

#### 🔸 Q1: Sum of Array Elements
- Used `reduce()` to sum all values in an array of numbers.

#### 🔸 Q2: Find Maximum Number
- Compared values in the `reduce()` callback to identify the largest number in an array.

#### 🔸 Q3: Flatten a 2D Array
- Combined nested arrays into a single flat array using `reduce()` and `concat()`.

#### 🔸 Q4: Count Occurrences of Elements
- Used `reduce()` to create an object that maps each element to its number of occurrences.

#### 🔸 Q5: Convert Array of Objects into a Single Array
- Extracted values (like names, ids) from an array of objects and combined them into one array.

#### 🔸 Q6: Create a Sentence from an Array of Words
- Used `reduce()` to join an array of words into a single sentence or string.

#### 🔸 Q7: Remove Duplicates from Array
- Eliminated repeated values using `reduce()` by checking if the element already exists in the accumulator.

#### 🔸 Q8: Group by Property
- Grouped an array of objects based on a specific property (e.g., type, category) using `reduce()`.

### 📚 Learned:
- **DOM (Document Object Model)** basics:
  - Understanding how HTML elements are represented as objects.
  - Accessing elements with methods like `getElementById`, `querySelector`.
  - Manipulating element content and styles using vanilla JS.
  - Adding/removing elements dynamically.

- **Vanilla JavaScript**:
  - No frameworks or libraries, only core JS methods for DOM manipulation.
  - Directly interacting with the browser environment.

### 🧠 Key Takeaways:
- `reduce()` is highly flexible for array data transformations.
- DOM manipulation in vanilla JS forms the foundation before moving to frameworks like React.
- Grouping data with `reduce()` is especially powerful for organizing complex datasets.
