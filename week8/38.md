## 🎯 JavaScript Test Practice – `reduce()` Method

### 📝 Activity Summary:
Practiced multiple interview-style questions using the `reduce()` method in JavaScript. Gained hands-on experience in array transformations, aggregation, and data manipulation using a single loop.

---

### 🔍 Questions Solved:

#### 🔸 Q1: Sum of Array Elements
- Used `reduce()` to sum all values in an array of numbers.

#### 🔸 Q2: Find Maximum Number
- Compared values in the `reduce()` callback to identify the largest number in an array.

#### 🔸 Q3: Flatten a 2D Array
- Combined nested arrays into a single flat array using `reduce()` and `concat()`.

#### 🔸 Q4: Count Occurrences of Elements
- Used `reduce()` to create an object that maps each element to its number of occurrences.

#### 🔸 Q5: Convert Array of Objects into a Single Array
- Extracted values (like names, ids) from an array of objects and combined them into one array.

#### 🔸 Q6: Create a Sentence from an Array of Words
- Used `reduce()` to join an array of words into a single sentence or string.

#### 🔸 Q7: Remove Duplicates from Array
- Used `reduce()` and conditionally pushed unique elements to the accumulator.

### 🧠 Key Learnings:
- `reduce()` can perform many operations beyond summing values, such as transformation, filtering, or data restructuring.
- It's a concise way to manage complex operations that typically require loops.
- Helps avoid the need for intermediate arrays or variables.
