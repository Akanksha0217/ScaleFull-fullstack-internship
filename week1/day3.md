# 📅 Day 3 - June 18, 2025

## ✅ Topics Learned

- Revision of HTML concepts from previous days
- How to add icons using:
  - Unicode symbols
  - `<i>` tags with icon libraries like Font Awesome
- Using the `<video>` tag to embed videos:
  - Attributes: `src`, `controls`, `autoplay`, `loop`, `poster`
- HTML Table Creation:
  - Elements: `<table>`, `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<tfoot>`, `<tr>`, `<th>`, `<td>`
- Basic understanding of HTML page sections using tables

## 🛠️ Work Done

- Embedded video with proper attributes for control and autoplay
- Created tables with headers, body content, and footers
- Added icons in the web content using `<i>` tags and class attributes
- Started a **mini project**: “Electronic Shop” website using HTML

## 💡 Notes

- The `<video>` tag allows adding multimedia; ensure correct file format and fallback text
- Tables are useful for structured data but not for layout design
- Always provide alternate text or captions for accessibility
- Icon libraries (e.g., Font Awesome) require CDN link in `<head>`

## 📁 Mini Project: Electronic Shop Website

A simple static HTML project showcasing:
- Homepage with a welcome message and logo/icon
- List of electronic products (using `<ul>`, `<table>`)
- Embedded promotional video
- Navigation links (for About, Contact, etc.)
